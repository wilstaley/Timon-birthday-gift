Dearest Timon,
Please accept my sincerest apologies as I deliver this birthday
gift to you in a severely late manner.  I figured out how to 
write the necessary code without using a local server.  I hope
this program proves to be of utmost usefulness whilst confirming
it is fundamentally indispensable.  I designed this page with 
hopes of symbolically displaying the duality of man.  Please 
open the index.html file in your favorite web browser and enjoy.
Yours truly,
Wilson
